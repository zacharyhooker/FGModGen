# FGModGen
Fantasy Grounds .mod generator in Python3

Helps import maps for the game and allows users to share map packs.

TODO:
  Support category splitting by filename or folders. Currently all files are stored under the same category (the mod name).
  Implement encounters and other basic module information for ease of packing.


#### These directions should still work, but after the most recent update (that implements encounters) you may need to change the construction parameters (xmlout/libdir).
